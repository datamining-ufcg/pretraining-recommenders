# Supplementary Material

In the Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the paper, we describe our experiments and present the observed results. However, given the resemblance between results, we chose to extract some of the plots to this supplementary material in order to complete the proposed discussion.

For Fig. 3 of the paper, we present these complementary results:

1. Predictive performance on the Source2Target pre-training scenario on MovieLens 100k and 1M, using MovieLens 9.9M and 9M as Source, respectively.

2. Predictive performance on the Source2Target pre-training scenario on MovieLens 100k and 1M, using MovieLens 19.9M and 19M as Source, respectively.
